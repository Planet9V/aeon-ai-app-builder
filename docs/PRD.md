# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## OpenCode Development Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-10-25  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Jim McKenney  
**Project:** OpenCode Platform MVP  

---

## Executive Summary

OpenCode is a **web-based development platform** that combines AI assistance, semantic code understanding, and structured workflow methodology (BMAD) to help developers build high-quality web applications faster. Unlike traditional IDEs or AI coding assistants, OpenCode integrates knowledge graphs to provide semantic understanding of codebases and uses the proven BMAD methodology to ensure consistent, repeatable development practices.

### Target Users
- **Individual developers** building web applications
- **Small teams** (2-5 developers) working on shared projects
- **Freelance developers** managing multiple client projects
- **Startup teams** needing fast, high-quality development

### Key Differentiators
1. **Semantic understanding** via knowledge graphs (not just syntax)
2. **BMAD methodology** built-in (Analyst, Architect, Dev, QA agents)
3. **Context-aware AI** (understands entire project, not just current file)
4. **Visual exploration** of code relationships and architecture
5. **Local-first** architecture (works offline, private, fast)

---

## Product Vision

**Mission Statement:**
"Empower developers to build better software faster through AI assistance, semantic understanding, and proven methodology."

**Vision (1 Year):**
OpenCode becomes the preferred development platform for small teams building web applications, known for its AI-powered workflow and semantic code understanding.

**Vision (3 Years):**
OpenCode is the industry standard for AI-assisted development, with a thriving ecosystem of plugins, templates, and community-contributed agents.
